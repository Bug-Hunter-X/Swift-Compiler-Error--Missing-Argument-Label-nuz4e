# Swift Compiler Error: Missing Argument Label

This example demonstrates a common Swift compiler error that occurs when calling functions with named parameters.  The error, "Missing argument label 'height'", arises when the label of a parameter is omitted during the function call.

The `calculateArea` function is defined with named parameters `width` and `height`.  Correct usage requires specifying both labels.  The provided code illustrates both the correct and incorrect usage, highlighting the error that will be generated by the compiler.

## Solution

The solution is simple: Ensure that you always provide the named labels as defined in the function signature when calling functions with named parameters. The corrected code in `bugSolution.swift` demonstrates the fix.
